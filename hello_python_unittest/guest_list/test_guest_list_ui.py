    # It will automatically unpatch when function is done.

    # Mock display_menu to return user's choices. Provide side_effect values - the value
    # returned by the function every time it's called. This will simulate
    # user selecting 2, then 1, then q

    # The regular display_menu method calls input, but since that's been replaced
    # with a Mock that doesn't do anything except return the provided values,
    # don't need to worry about providing return vals for that.

    # but do care what it's called with.

    # Provide the mocks in reverse order to the order of the decorators.
    # And you'll need the mocks if you want to find out how the mock was used,
