You are a recycling truck driver. You'd like to collect some statistics on how much each house is recycling.
Assume the house numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3....

Each house put their recycling in crates.

Figure out the house number with the most recycling, and the number of crates that house recycled.
Same for house with the least, and the number of crates for that house.
